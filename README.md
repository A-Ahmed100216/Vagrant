# First Virtual Box and Vagrant Dev Environment

This repo is our first virtual Environment
## Virtual Box
What is it?

## Vagrant

* Vagrant boxes - preloaded vagrant files that create virtual machines. Usually just an OS
* Open source Linux distribution
* Written in ruby
* Ubuntu is an open source OS.
* Ubuntu with GUI (graphical user interface) looks and works like a standard desktop
* Ubuntu headless - basically a terminal, no GUI (this is the one we will use)
    * faster
    * more secure
    * lighter

## Main Commands

* `vagrant init`
* `vagrant init <box>` search for boxes
* `vagrant up`
* `vagrant destroy` - delete a box

## Task 1
* vagrant up with ubuntu xenial64
* Vagrant destroy
* Delete your vagrantfile
Use vagrant init to create a vagrantfile with centos 7
* vagrant up again
* Vagrant destroy again

## Task 2
* Create a vagrant box with ubuntu version 18.04
* find the commands to ssh into machine
* Create a README.md file inside the virtual machine and write your name and favourite movie.
